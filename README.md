If you are changing protocol buffer interface, `protoc` program must be
installed. This can be done at

https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases

by downloading `protoc-3.3.0-linux-x86_64.zip` if running 64bit linux or
`protoc-3.3.0-linux-x86_32.zip` if running 32bit linux. The zip contains an
executable that can be copied up yours `/usr/local/bin/`.
